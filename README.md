# Get Started

`yarn install && yarn start` then visit http://localhost:3000 to begin.

## Notes

-   This application uses the kickbox API which is only limited to 100 requests per key.
-   If 100 request limit exceeded, fallback to development key by uncommenting line 16 in ~/server/index.tsx
-   To use production key, make sure line 17 is uncommented in ~/server/index.tsx
